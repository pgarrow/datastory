# ENGL688K Assignment 3: Rubble as it Relates to Ruins in the realm of Twitter
## By Philip Garrow
### May 7th, 2018

In Professor Kari Kraus’s “Ruins: Literatures and Theories of Decay” course this semester, we spent weeks contemplating the meanings of words associated with age and deterioration.  One term that we addressed extensively was “rubble.”  To ground our conversation, we read the introduction to Gastón R. Gordillo’s 2014 book, *Rubble: The Afterlife of Destruction*.  One of his goals was to address “how rubble affects human bodies and, more important, of how the same object may affect people with different class and cultural backgrounds very differently” (5).  While thinking about how Twitter and the Twitter Archive (TWARC) could be useful in my own studies, it struck me that there might be value in determining how “rubble” is employed in social media conversations. 

On May 1st, 2018, I executed a search for “rubble” via the TWARC prompt within Google’s Cloud Shell command line emulator.  Thanks to detailed written guidance from Purdom Lindblad and Ed Summers, I organized the retrieved information in a Google Spreadsheet.  The primary data is in the first tab, and the other tabs were "pivots" that I used to analyze whether any individual users employed the term more than others as well as which language they used in their posts.  My focus was on the content of the actual tweets vice qualitative metrics, so I did not include any graphs or charts.

The results were intriguing.  “Rubble” appeared in 17,995 tweets during the two-week period that my search encompassed.  Per the "pivot" tabs, the overwhelming majority (17,662 or 98.15 percent) of those occurrences were written in English and the vast majority of individuals only used the word "rubble" only once within the sample timeframe.  I read the initial 200 results to identify trends, patters, frequencies, and outliers.  To borrow from Martha Kang’s identification of “the 7 Different Types of Data Stories,” I assess my efforts as an attempt to tell a data-based analytical tale through a concerted effort to “Highlight Contrasts.”  Apparently a more versatile word than I gave it credit for, “rubble” popped up in a variety of contexts – from jokes to laments to current affairs conversations.  The “Find” tool proved useful in identifying other words often paired with “rubble.”  For example, the phrase “reduced to rubble” was used in 65 tweets, while “human rubble” – apparently coined by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) Inc. announcer Jim Ross during a 2001 episode of *Friday Night Smackdown* -  appeared 81 times.  Further, as I revealed in my Ruins class blog post, the proper noun for the fictional “Barney Rubble” was incorporated into 131 tweets, a figure almost three times larger than that of his cartoon spouse “Betty Rubble” – a *Flintstones* gender imbalance worth contemplating further.  

During a 2017 lecture, Purdom provided a clear explanation of the “Advocacy by Design” concept.  She stated that it “articulates a shared understanding and practice that fronts questions of **how people are represented in, or are subjects of, academic work; questions of who reads and uses our work** as well as **those who collaborate and contribute to our work**” [emphasis in original] (4).  My “rubble” data set does not present many challenging advocacy questions; it is a word that lacks – to my knowledge, at least – any gendered associations or derogatory implications.  But it is worth contemplating the ethics of my posting – both here and on the Ruins class blog site – about individual uses of “rubble” without obtaining the express consent of any original posters.  While one could argue that each person in my data set should have anticipated that their comments might well be subject to academic study, I doubt very many of them ever grappled explicitly with that thought.  
Although I have not attempted to characterize any individual tweets, it would be easy to do so, and some Tweeters might take umbrage if I chose to label their efforts using loaded terms like “racist,” “narrow-minded,” or even just “poorly-written.”  While it is difficult to envision a means for my Google Spreadsheet to be used for nefarious purposes, it is possible; misogynists and Twitter trolls may be able to make something of the Barney vs. Betty situation, for example.  But overall, I assess the risk of offending or harming anyone with this data set as low, and I thus elected not to restrict public access to my Google Spreadsheet.
